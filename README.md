### 1.	Introduction
### 2.	Feature descriptions
### 3.	Import all required libraries
### 4.	Data Extraction
    - Loading dataset
    - Renaming column names for easier name convention
    - Changing the format of few variables like “Start” and “End” time
### 5.	Data Cleaning
    - Finding null values
    - Removing/handling null values
### 6.	Exploratory data analysis
    - Finding the trip route category and plotting it in the form of bar graph - ONE WAY TRIP OR TWO-WAY TRIP
    - Busiest Bike by Times
    - Visual of most used bike based on Number of Trips - WHICH BIKE IS USED THE MOST
    - Popular start station and end station
    - Finding the maximum and minimum trip duration
    - Using latitude and longitude find the exact location of stations
    - Finding the most popular pick up time of any bike
    - Finding the most popular trips – To maintain the stations which are high in demand
    - Finding the trip duration
    - Finding the famous passholder type according to plan duration – Flex pass, monthly pass, walk up
    - Finding the peak time for different passholder #Separating date and Start Time and End Time – For each pass which hour of the day is busiest
### 7.	Finding the co relation between different passholder type and different stations
### 8.	Perform modeling
    - Perform logistic regression to predict the passholder type
    - Use Random forest classifier to predict the passholder type
    - Use Decision Tree classifier to predict the passholder type
### 9.	Conclusion

> We need to create a .py file also where we will define all the functions and call them to get the output.
